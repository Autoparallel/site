description = "There is a set of three equivalences between category theory (algebra), type theory (computation), and logic (proofs) that are known as the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence. I find these relationships fascinating and want to explore them further. Not only in a theoretical way, but also in a practical way for designing safe and scalable software. Ultimately, I want to get into programming languages that offer theorem proving and venture deep into homotopy type theory and higher categories."
