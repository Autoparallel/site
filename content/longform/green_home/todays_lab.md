These all are miraculously ubiquitous objects whether you are in physics, computer science, or mathematics. We will see how one can go from the algebraic perspective straight into implementation and how we can extract additional features of these objects naturally."

Notes:

one of the things that's so nice about proxmox is just testing out services quickly and easily. Also, other perks like backing up a VM or LXC and destroying it but saving those backups just incase I want to bring back the service later is sweet (e.g., headscale and ollama).
