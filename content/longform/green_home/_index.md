description = "Messing with hardware and software is one of my biggest hobbies outside of fitness related stuff. There's a lot of options as far as DIY goes. This series is going to be about this sort of thing and it will grow and adapt over time. Expect to see things ranging from managing a cluster at home, to building IoT devices, to features, commits, and issues on open source software."
