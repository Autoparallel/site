## About Me

My name is Colin Roberts.
I have a passion for mathematics, physics, and computer science.
Some specific interests were previously mathematical physics via Riemannian geometry, PDEs, Clifford analysis, Hodge theory, and inverse problems.
I also dabbled in sensor fusion, data assimilation, and plasma physics.

Now I find myself in an open arc of developing software on and related to cryptography. 
Here we want beautiful math and beautiful software.
We want it to be provable, modular, extensible, and composable.

Here are some projects I have worked on or am currently working on:
- [ronkathon](https://github.com/pluto/ronkathon): Cryptographic primitives, self contained, for learning, and for collaboration.
- [arbiter](https://github.com/anthias-labs/arbiter): Agent-based simulation framework for Ethereum execution environments.
- [tensor](https://github.com/Autoparallel/tensor): Rust library for multilinear algebra interface.
- [type_sheaf](https://github.com/Autoparallel/type_sheaf): Sheaves of types in Rust. WIP.
- Sheaves of modules in Lean4. TODO.

- The [Borromean rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings) are a set of three interlocking rings with the special property that if any one ring is removed, the remaining two are not linked. 
Mathematically, we say the Borromean links have [linking number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linking_number) zero. 
However, higher order linking can be detected using [Massey products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massey_product) which shows that the Borromean rings are "triply linked" in a sense.
Linking, braiding, and knotting are all important concepts in topology and are used in the study of [magnetic fields, fluid dynamics](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jmp/article-abstract/54/1/013515/983781/Generalized-Gauss-maps-and-integrals-for-three?redirectedFrom=fulltext), and [DNA](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/circle/documents/2020/Ayinon_2020.pdf).
