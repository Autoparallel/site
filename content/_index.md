I am a mathematician and physicist turned research engineer with a deep passion for computer science. My journey has taken me from theoretical explorations in mathematical physics—including Riemannian geometry, PDEs, Clifford analysis, Hodge theory, and inverse problems, as well as sensor fusion, data assimilation, and plasma physics—to leading applied research and development in cryptography, DeFi, and distributed systems.

Currently, my focus is on architecting innovative solutions for complex challenges in the cryptographic space, including developing cutting-edge proving systems and secure computation techniques. I have significant experience in modeling, simulation (notably as the lead developer of the Arbiter framework), and building novel financial primitives. I thrive on leading teams to impactful execution and am driven by the desire to be challenged and make a difference.

In all my work, the goal remains to create beautiful math and beautiful software: provable, modular, extensible, and composable.

Here are some projects I have worked on or am currently working on:
- [arbiter](https://github.com/harnesslabs/arbiter): Agent-based simulation framework.
- [cova](https://github.com/harnesslabs/cova): Abstract mathematics made computational.
- [ronkathon](https://github.com/pluto/ronkathon): Cryptographic primitives, self contained, for learning, and for collaboration.
