# autoparallel.xyz
This site is built with Zola. 
The theme was deeply inspired by the [Anemone theme](https://anemone.pages.dev). 
I learned a lot by using that theme as well as the [Zola documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/introduction/) and other themes.
I appreciate the openness I have seen so far in the Zola community. 
It has helped me immensely to build this site I can call my own ðŸ˜Š.

## Docker
I no longer self host this site with Docker or LXC, but instead host with Github pages.
